            <h2>E-waste</h2>
            <p>On this website we are going to talk about E-Waste, more specifically about people’s awareness and solutions on the subject. But first we are  going to give a quick introduction to what is an E-Waste or electronic waste:</p>

                <h2 class="TitoChi2">What is it?</h2>
                <p>E-Waste is all electronic devices, like: phones, dishwashers, fridges, washing machines, laptops and all other electronic devices. And this leads to an ever increasing rate of waste production because newer phones and computers lead to older devices becoming obsolete and by proxy getting thrown away. But we can make a difference by talking about the issue and following some solutions, but i will talk about both in their specific pages</p>
                
                <p>Unfortunately a majority of this waste ends up in Accra in Ghana, since it gets used to send both E-Waste and fast fashion waste, so it is very polluted and the landfills aren’t good for the locals. This is a problem because the lands get used to make landfills instead of buildings to grow the local economy, so it hurts Ghana’s already struggling economy. This means that its growth is heavily stunted by this meaning that: the locals have worse conditions if they live near the landfills, the lands get heavily polluted meaning crops won’t grow well and the economy will take a very long time to develop. So make sure to recycle your waste.</p>
