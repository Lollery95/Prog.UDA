                    <h3>Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR)</h3>
                    <p>EPR policies require manufacturers to take responsibility for the entire lifecycle of their products, including collection and recycling when they reach end-of-life. This approach has been implemented in the EU through the WEEE Directive and in various forms across other regions.</p>
                </div>

                    <h3>Right to Repair Movement</h3>
                    <p>Legislation supporting consumers' right to repair their devices is gaining momentum worldwide. These laws require manufacturers to make repair information, tools, and parts available to consumers and independent repair shops, extending product lifespans.</p>

                <div class="arg">
                    <div class="cerchio">3</div>
                    <h3>Circular Design Principles</h3>
                    <p>Companies are increasingly designing products with circularity in mind, making devices easier to repair, upgrade, and eventually recycle. Modular phones, laptops with replaceable components, and other innovations reflect this shift.</p>

                    <h3>Advanced Recycling Technologies</h3>
                    <p>New technologies are being developed to recover materials from e-waste more efficiently. These include advanced mechanical processing, hydrometallurgical methods, biometallurgy, and automated sorting systems that can identify and separate different materials.</p>

                    <div class="cerchio">5</div>
                    <h3>Urban Mining</h3>
                    <p>The concept of urban mining treats e-waste as a resource rather than trash. Studies show that recovering gold from e-waste can be more economically viable than traditional mining, with 1 ton of circuit boards containing 40-800 times the amount of gold found in 1 ton of ore.</p>

                    <h3>Product-as-a-Service Models</h3>
                    <p>Some companies now offer devices as a service rather than a product to buy and own. Customers lease devices, and the company maintains responsibility for upgrades, repairs, and eventual recycling, encouraging better design and resource efficiency.</p>

                </div>
            </div>
            <p>The implementation of e-waste solutions has led to significant improvements in how electronic waste is managed globally. Countries with comprehensive EPR systems have seen higher collection and recycling rates, while technological innovations have increased the efficiency of material recovery.</p>
            <p>Consumer awareness has also grown substantially, with more people seeking out repair options, buying refurbished products, and properly disposing of their old electronics.</p>
