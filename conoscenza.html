            <p>To better understand the scale of the e-waste problem, it's important to look at the numbers. Statistics help us see how much electronic waste is produced, how little is recycled, and how the problem is growing every year. In this section, we show some key data to highlight the urgency of taking action.</p>

Blanditiis impedit pariatur quas totam ipsam incidunt porro in, inventore omnis, distinctio reprehenderit illo dolore laborum eaque, aliquid nam id ad dolores!The most prominent reason is unawareness, most people aren’t taught about this so it’s only natural that not everyone knows about it. This could be an easy fix, because it can be taught in school or even in the workplace. Having more people know about the problem can make a huge difference, because more people would pay more attention. And so less people would unknowingly contribute to the problem, making the problem</p>
